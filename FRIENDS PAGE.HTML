        <h1>About Friends</h1>
        <p>
            Friendship is a cherished part of my life, providing support, laughter and unforgettable memories.While number of friends I have may vary time to time,what remain constant is the value they bring in my life.<br>I am fortunate to have a diverse group of friends,each contributing something unique to my life. From childhood companions who have seen me through thick and thin to collage buddies with whom I shared late night study sessions and adventure towards the road of archiving our goals.<br>
            To you my friends<br> Thank you for being a cntant source of joy,inspiration,and support in life. Your presence enriches my journey and I am grateful fo the countless memories we have created together.
